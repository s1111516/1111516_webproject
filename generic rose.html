							<p>《On The Ground》歌詞:<br>
								My life's been magic, seems fantastic<br>
								I used to have a hole in the wall with a mattress<br>
								Funny when you want it, suddenly you have it<br>
								You find out that your gold's just plastic<br>
								Every day, every night<br>
								I've been thinkin' back on you and I<br>
								Every day, every night<br>
								I worked my whole life<br>
								Just to get right, just to be like<br>
								"Look at me, I'm never coming down"<br>
								I worked my whole life<br>
								Just to get high, just to realize<br>
								Everything I need is on the<br>
								Everything I need is on the ground<br>
								On the ground<br>
								Everything I need is on the ground<br>
								(Nah, but they don't hear me though)<br>
								(Yeah, what goes up must come down)<br>
								(Nah, but they don't hear me though)<br>
								(You're runnin' out of time)<br>
								My world's been hectic, seems electric<br>
								But I've been waking up with your voice in my head<br>
								And I'm tryna send a message and let you know that<br>
								Every single minute I'm without you, I regret it<br>
								Every day, every night<br>
								I've been thinkin' back on you and I<br>
								Every day, every night<br>
								I worked my whole life<br>
								Just to get right, just to be like<br>
								"Look at me, I'm never coming down"<br>
								I worked my whole life<br>
								Just to get high, just to realize<br>
								Everything I need is on the<br>
								Everything I need is on the ground<br>
								On the ground<br>
								Everything I need is on the ground<br>
								(Nah, but they don't hear me though)<br>
								(Yeah, what goes up must come down)<br>
								(Nah, but they don't hear me though)<br>
								(You're runnin' out of time)<br>
								I'm way up in the clouds<br>
								And they say I've made it now<br>
								But I figured it out<br>
								Everything I need is on the ground (yeah, yeah)<br>
								Just drove by your house (just drove by your house)<br>
								So far from you now (so far from you now)<br>
								But I figured it out<br>
								Everything I need is on the<br>
								Everything I need is on the ground<br>
								On the ground<br>
								Everything I need is on the ground<br>
								(Nah, but they don't hear me though)<br>
								On the ground<br>
								(Nah, but they don't hear me though)<br>
								Everything I need is on the ground</p><br>
								
							<p>《Gone》歌詞:<br>
								I thought that you'd remember, but it seems that you forgot<br>
								It's hard for me to blame you when you were already lost<br>
								Oh, yeah, I'm tired of always waiting, oh, yeah, yeah<br>
								I see you changed your number, that's why you don't get my calls<br>
								I gave you all of me, now you don't wanna be involved<br>
								Oh, yeah, yeah, I really gotta face it, oh, yeah, yeah<br>
								I just wanna be the one<br>
								But to you, we're already done<br>
								Tell me, why'd you have to hit-and-run me?<br>
								Now I'm all alone crying ugly<br>
								You broke my heart just for fun<br>
								Took my love and just left me numb<br>
								Now it's eight in the morning<br>
								Hate in the morning (all because of you)<br>
								Another story that's sad and true<br>
								I can feel the pain, can you?<br>
								You had to be the one to let me down<br>
								To color me blue<br>
								Hate to see you with someone new<br>
								I'll put a curse on her and you<br>
								Ain't no looking back, now you're dead and gone<br>
								My love is gone too<br>
								All my love is go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-one<br>
								All my love is go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-one<br>
								All my love is go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-one<br>
								All my love is gone<br>
								Now you're dead and gone<br>
								All my love is gone and the hate has grown<br>
								I'm standing all alone and I'm searching for something<br>
								But I can't feel nothing<br>
								I pack my bags and go, this don't feel like home<br>
								Too much darkness for a rainbow, I feel so used<br>
								How am I supposed to live without you? I refuse, yeah<br>
								I just wanna be the one<br>
								But to you, we're already done<br>
								Tell me, why'd you have to hit-and-run me?<br>
								Now I'm all alone crying ugly<br>
								You broke my heart just for fun<br>
								Took my love and just left me numb<br>
								Now it's eight in the morning<br>
								Hate in the morning (all because of you)<br>
								Another story that's sad and true<br>
								I can feel the pain, can you?<br>
								You had to be the one to let me down<br>
								To color me blue<br>
								Hate to see you with someone new<br>
								I'll put a curse on her and you<br>
								Ain't no looking back, now you're dead and gone<br>
								My love is gone, too<br>
								All my love is go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-one<br>
								All my love is go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-one<br>
								All my love is go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-one<br>
								All my love is gone<br>
								Now you're dead and gone</p>
